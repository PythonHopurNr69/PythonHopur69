# PythonHopur69

#For this project we are using Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming language.

#Step 1
#Download python from python.org, use 3.61 or greater

#Step 2
#download pygame from this website: "https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml"
#Then install pygame using pip tool, with this code in terminal "python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user"
#and this can happen to some versions of visual studio code, but if the code doesn't seem to work you might need to add a bit of code to your visual studio code settings. (itÂ´s becasue "pygame" is kind of old, and there has been new things added in vs code as "protection" but pygame is completely safe)
#to accses the settings use "CTRL+SHIFT+P" and search "settings(json)" there you sould add the folowing code inside the {} brackets
 	"python.linting.pylintArgs": [
"----extension-pkg-whitelist=1xml"
]   
#sorry for the inconvenience but this can happen in vscode

#if you want to run our game in the terminal after you have installed pygame, you can doubble click the "Main.ba" text file in the directory or run "Main.ba" in terminal. (apperantly IDLE and pygame don't work well together )
